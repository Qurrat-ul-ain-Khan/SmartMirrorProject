# SmartMirrorProject
This project proposes the development of a Smart Mirror System using two Arduino microcontrollers—one acting as a Master (handling Bluetooth communication) and the other as a Slave (driving a TFT display). The system receives user-defined data from a custom Android application built using MIT App Inventor.

🧠Objective:
•	To design and implement a smart mirror capable of displaying real-time information.
•	To establish wireless communication between a mobile application and the mirror system using Bluetooth.
•	To demonstrate a stable master–slave communication protocol between two Arduino boards.
•	To display time and custom messages using a TFT display.


🛠 Hardware Components:
•	Arduino Uno (Master)
Handles Bluetooth communication.
•	Arduino Uno (Slave)
Drives the TFT display.
•	Bluetooth Module (HC-05 )
Receives data from the Android app.
•	TFT Display (2.4” LCD)
Displays time and text.
•	Two-Way Mirror 


🎀Conclusion:
The project demonstrates a functional smart mirror system utilizing dual Arduinos for modular design. The Master Arduino effectively handles Bluetooth communication while the Slave Arduino manages the display output.
